## Utilize Project
To run this project open up the integrated terminal.  Run node server.js to open up the local host 3001.  You can open up the site, click on the "Get Started" button.  This will open the notes url.  You may enter in a note title and note text, then the save button will appear.  You may save your note and view the tile on the left hand column.  Click on the note title and you can see and edit your note again.  I used the express, file system and util modules.
